# William O'Brien Homework4 - code quiz
This homework assignment involves the creation of a basic JavaScript knowledge quiz, making use of elements of HTML, js, and optionally (but quite neccessarily) CSS.

This is the first assignment I have found to be easier to manage by using multiple of each file type, and as such, this has been implemented.
